4.2,lots of homework ,  tough grader ,  skip class? you won't pass. ,NA,NA,"Very entertaining prof. He is willing to help. Very nice and laid back, however he has no grading rubric and is not easy. But it was a relaxing class with not much reading and only 3 papers.",Passives
4.2,lots of homework ,  tough grader ,  skip class? you won't pass. ,NA,NA,"he is a nice guy and his class is pretty fun. he is a really tough grader though. if you can, take a different teacher for english. i had Professor King for english 2 and did much better than I did in english 1 with zorn",Passives
4.2,lots of homework ,  tough grader ,  skip class? you won't pass. ,NA,NA,Professor Zorn is awesome! Super hippy and laid back.. He tends to talk a lot but he's a funny guy.there are only 3 assignments for the whole quarter and there pretty easy. He's just a tough grader but his main motive is to prove that you improved. I definately reccomend taking him for an easy laid back class. Plus he cancels classes all the time.,Passives
4.2,lots of homework ,  tough grader ,  skip class? you won't pass. ,NA,NA,"Jeffrey Zorn is an amazing ex-hippie, Grateful Dead-following, blustering professor. He is, for the most part, an incredible teacher, but the one problem is his quizzes. He is incredibly exacting and it is difficult to receive full credit unless you are able to predict exactly what he wants to hear from you. Class is always interesting, though.",Passives
4.2,lots of homework ,  tough grader ,  skip class? you won't pass. ,NA,NA,"One of those professors who will either love or despise you. If he loves you (i.e. if you tolerate his odd mannerisms + laugh at his jokes to feed his ego) you coast. If not he will ""jokingly"" single you out in class and start arguments with you that end with you looking like a fool. Considers himself brilliant + constantly references his own work.",Passives

4.2,lots of homework ,  tough grader ,  skip class? you won't pass. ,NA,NA,Very very hard grader- you MUST keep up on all of the readings. But he gives excellent lectures and is very willing to help students with the assignments. Very funny- keeps you interested. I'd recommend him despite the really hard work.,Passives
4.2,lots of homework ,  tough grader ,  skip class? you won't pass. ,NA,NA,"He is the man. A little unfocused at times, but a great sports fan, and he will help you any way he can.

4.2,lots of homework ,  tough grader ,  skip class? you won't pass. ,NA,NA,best teacher and a great friend still today. quite an ex-hippy which is fine with me!!!! i love Dr. Zorn...,Passives
4.2,lots of homework ,  tough grader ,  skip class? you won't pass. ,NA,NA,"acts friendly saying things like quizes will be a breeze, but really he is incredibly picky. A right answer has to be exactly what he is looking for, which is usually very precise. I had him edit my essay, did his corrections + more and still wasnt an A",Passives

2,lots of homework ,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Terrible professor, was extremely easy for me to do the work in the class, but that's because it all revolves around study guides and learning where countries were on the map. I can assure you that this class is a waste of time, and that this teacher will spend 95% of the class time talking about his grandson or other things other then teaching.",Detractors
2,lots of homework ,NA,NA,NA,NA,DO NOT RECOMMEND!,Detractors
2,lots of homework ,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Worthless lump of a man. Currently in his class, and DOES NOT TEACH. His class sessions are him talking about unrelated topics and assigning a study guide spanning two chapters that he doesn't talk about AT ALL. Then he has you turn them in, and then do a test a few weeks later with the same questions. Terrible prof., the book is the only teacher.",Detractors
2,lots of homework ,NA,NA,NA,NA,"He is not a terrible teacher. The class is really very easy. You just have to tell him every class period that he forgot something. You can't expect him to do what he is supposed to. Just follow the study guide and the tests are pretty well straight off that.Also, sit in the front and talk alot. He will help you more if he knows you're interested.",Detractors

2,lots of homework ,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Joshi is a rude man with a huge ego. I can understand him.This issue isnt his speech. Half of what he says is gibberish,unrelated to the class.

Do not take!",Detractors

2,lots of homework ,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DON'T TAKE HIM. He 'forgets' to grade things and loses everything. If you have to take him, make copies of EVERYTHING.

2,lots of homework ,NA,NA,NA,NA,talks about everything buy geography. Didn't give me credit for 2 quizes and a test b/c he forgot.,Detractors
2,lots of homework ,NA,NA,NA,NA,"If you wanna class that you take VERY little noted, cant understand the teacher and you learn nothing in class then this is the teacher for you. He talks bout his life more than anything. You do need to stay with the schedule or you will fail. Map tests are easy and chapter tests are easy and you can retake them, but I wouldnt pick his class to tak",Detractors
2,lots of homework ,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The first day he seems hard to understand, but you get used to it. His class as a whole is simple, do the study guides and homework he gives you Attendance is not necessary as long as you keep up with the work If you ask him a question though, he tends to turn it around, and ask you the exact question you just asked him so not helpful in that sense",Detractors
2,lots of homework ,NA,NA,NA,NA,"he is as easy as they come. if u can't pass his class, u should go back to kidergarten. and for the ones who can't understand him, open up to the world. not everybody in in the world(or america for this matter) talk with a country accent.",Detractors

2,lots of homework ,NA,NA,NA,NA,I hated this class... it was a waste of time and money... The first week all you talk about is his althritis. You dont do any geography unless you do the study guides.

Although she was helpful when it came to projects, the answers were usually vague and not direct. When grading, I felt as if she graded based off of personal opinion rather than the facts that were clearly on the paper. Helps you to become a good writer but not a great one.",Detractors

3.7,tough grader ,  gives good feedback ,  participation matters ,  lots of homework ,  extra credit ,"Lots of reading, naturally as it is a Brit Lit class. Lots of papers, but most of them don't get graded until the end of semester. Meaning you don't get feedback on your work and what you should fix (from your professor) until its all said and done with. You do get feedback from your peers, this is mandatory. Overall, its a mostly enjoyable class.",Passives

I learned a lot from him. It was a little hard to catch up in his class and the assignments at first but his lecture/feedback always makes sense and logical. He spared a lot of his time every time I asked questions. I would take his class again.,Passives
3.7,tough grader ,  gives good feedback ,  participation matters ,  lots of homework ,  extra credit ,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Every single review on here is completely accurate. If you do not want this class to be your life, DO NOT TAKE. He is rude, condescending, and you do not learn in his class. His lectures do not pertain to the content. He assigns excess reading that is never covered. He also has very basic, if that, communication skills.",Passives
3.7,tough grader ,  gives good feedback ,  participation matters ,  lots of homework ,  extra credit ,"Lectures well, but has a tendency to go off on tangents and can come off condescending at times. He takes forever to grade assignments, and grades as if you're a professional. His instructions are fairly clear, but the course is rigorous, and if you don't have time to sit down and plan essays out you'll be lucky to get out with a B.",Passives

He took forever to reply to emails, and when he did, he was rude and short with me. He took forever to grade papers, so you basically don't know where you stand in the class all semester. He graded very harshly on papers, and makes you feel stupid.",Passives

Although I had my paper proofread by writing labs, he nailed me because he didn't like my MLA format and what I had to say. The MLA was checked by professionals and my views are simply that, my views. Gives incompletes if you don't label exactly how he said regardless writing",Passives

I accidentally sighed up for the 8 week class and with 5 other classes--it was brutal. I didn't flunk, but the workload was a lot. He doesn't give encouraging comments, least none that I ever got.
